**R2Droid** is a modern, native Android GUI for the [Radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2) reverse engineering framework. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it brings powerful binary analysis capabilities to mobile devices with a clean, touch-friendly interface.

[**🇨🇳 中文说明**](README_CN.md)

## ✨ Features

*   **Project Management**: Save, load, and restore analysis sessions. Support for custom project directories.
*   **Hex Viewer**: High-performance, virtualized hex editor with editing capabilities (`wx`, `w`, `wa`).
*   **Disassembly**: Infinite scrolling disassembly view with syntax highlighting, jump arrows, and navigation history.
*   **Decompiler**: View pseudo-code generated by r2's analysis plugins.
*   **Embedded Terminal**: Full-featured terminal environment using `r2pipe` and `termux-view` for executing raw r2 commands.
*   **Analysis Views**:
    *   Binary Overview (Arch, Bits, OS, etc.)
    *   Sections, Symbols, Imports, Relocations
    *   Strings and Functions list
    *   Cross-references (Xrefs)
*   **Customization**: Dark/Light themes, custom fonts, language switching (English/Chinese), and custom `.radare2rc` configuration.

## 🚀 Roadmap / TODO

*   [ ] **Optimize Hex Editor performance**: Improve virtualization logic for massive files.
*   [ ] **Add Call Graph (VV)**: Visual graph view for function calls and basic blocks.
*   [ ] **Manual Analysis Button**: Trigger specific analysis commands (`aa`, `aaa`, `aaaa`) on demand.
*   [ ] **Terminal Helper Keys**: Add a row of extra keys (ESC, Tab, Ctrl, Arrows) above the keyboard.
*   [ ] **Enhanced Jump History**: Better back/forward navigation stack handling.
*   [ ] **Search Interface**: Global search for bytes, strings, and instructions.
*   [ ] **Function Cross-references (axf)**: Detailed view for function usage.
*   [ ] **ESIL Emulation**: UI for stepping through code using ESIL.
*   [ ] **Debounce Mechanism**: Improve UI responsiveness on heavy operations.

## 🛠️ Build
